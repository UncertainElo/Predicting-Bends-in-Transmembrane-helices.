# Aims to predict bends in Transmembrane Helices using their Amino acid sequence.

Refer to the Neural Network Report.md file to know about the theory, model architecture and everything
else related to the project.

Currenlty the work is going on to develop a ML model based on suppor vector machine
for the same task, since the NN model was not giving good results.
